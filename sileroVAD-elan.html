        This is a local recognizer that offers voice activity detection
        using
        <a href="https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad">Silero VAD</a>,
        an open-source Python package that separates audio into speech vs.
        non-speech.  The user is able to select an input audio file linked
        to this transcript, which this recognizer then passes on to Voxseg
        for processing, producing a new tier containing the segments of speech
        that Silero has identified.
